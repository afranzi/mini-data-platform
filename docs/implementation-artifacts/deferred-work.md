# Deferred Work

Tracks review findings that are real but not actionable in the story under review — assigned to a later story by the planned scope split. Pull these into the owning story when it is created/implemented.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-pin-kubernetes-1-33-in-terraform (2026-06-19)

- **[High] Provider may not serve k8s v1.33.10 → Story 1.2.** The minikube provider is locked at `~> 0.3.10` (`terraform/main/providers.tf`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`). Its bundled minikube may lack kubeadm/images for `v1.33.10`, so `terraform apply` could fail or **silently downgrade** to minikube's default version (FR1 unmet). Story 1.2 must verify provider/minikube support for 1.33.10 and bump `~> 0.3.10` + `terraform init -upgrade` if needed (AR13/G2).
- **[High] Deprecated/removed-API + addon audit → Story 1.2.** Audit manifests/addons (ingress, ingress-dns, metrics-server in `modules/k8s/minicluster/01-cluster.tf`; ArgoCD/oboukili provider; Postgres) for APIs removed/deprecated across 1.29→1.33 (e.g. `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta2/3`). Use `pluto`/`kubent` against rendered manifests (FR2).
- **[Med] Resource footprint → Story 1.3 / NFR2.** Module `memory`/`cpus` defaults (`8g`/`4`, `modules/k8s/minicluster/00-variables.tf`) may not reliably boot a heavier 1.33 control-plane under qemu2. Verify node Ready + no OOM after recreate; raise the minikube allocation lever if needed (D10/CM1).
- **[Med] Stale version in docs → Story 3.4.** `docs/project-context.md` still says Kubernetes `v1.29.2` (currently framed as upgrade-target, so acceptable now). Refresh version references once the upgrade lands as part of docs regeneration (FR22).

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-audit-deprecated-removed-kubernetes-apis (2026-06-19)

- **[High → Story 1.3] Confirm v1.33.10 boots on the 0.6.0-bundled minikube.** Provider 0.6.0 embeds a newer minikube whose `stable` resolves to v1.34.0; our pin is `v1.33.10`. At cluster recreate, verify the bundled minikube fetches kicbase/kubeadm assets for 1.33.10 and the node reports `v1.33.10` (not a silent fallback). [terraform/main/01-cluster.tf:2]
- **[Med → Story 1.3] socket_vmnet/qemu2 runtime check.** `network = socket_vmnet` + `driver = qemu2` are runtime args `terraform validate` cannot verify. Confirm the external `socket_vmnet` daemon/binary version is compatible with the minikube embedded in provider 0.6.0. [terraform/main/01-cluster.tf:8-9]
- **[Low → Story 1.3] Stale state backup schema.** `terraform/main/state/terraform.tfstate.backup` carries the removed `network_plugin` attribute (0.3.x schema). Inert because 1.3 recreates from clean state; remove/ignore if that backup is ever restored under provider 0.6.0.

## Deferred from: Story 1.3 partial completion (2026-06-20)

- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.7] Verify GitOps app-sync (airflow/postgres) on the docker cluster.** `terraform apply` created the ArgoCD Project + `postgres` + `airflow` Applications; both reach **Synced/Healthy**. Story 1.3 AC#3/#4 now fully met. ⚠️ **Correction:** the host mapping must be `127.0.0.1 argocd.data airflow.data`, **not** `192.168.49.2` — the docker-driver `minikube tunnel` binds the ingress to `127.0.0.1` (the node IP is not host-routable on macOS). The `192.168.49.2` instruction in this note was wrong.
- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.7] Airflow ingress reachability on docker.** `https://airflow.data` (→ `127.0.0.1` via tunnel) serves the UI; `/api/v2/monitor/health` returns all-healthy; SimpleAuth login works. Ingress is HTTP-only (no `tls:`) — `base_url=https` is cosmetic locally; UI functions over the tunnel on HTTP.
- **[Low → ongoing] minikube IP / tunnel binding.** Host access uses `127.0.0.1` (docker-tunnel binding), not the node IP. Re-confirm `sudo minikube tunnel -p data` is running after any recreate.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3 / docker switch (2026-06-20) → Story 3.4 (docs)

- **[Med] `terraform/main/readme.md` setup is stale.** It instructs `brew install socket_vmnet` + `sudo brew services start socket_vmnet` (qemu2 era). With the docker driver this is wrong — update the quickstart to the docker driver + note that `minikube tunnel` (+ `/etc/hosts`) is needed for `argocd.data`/`airflow.data` host access.
- **[Low-Med] `terraform/modules/k8s/minicluster/main.tf` doc comment** says "the docker driver does not support the ingress add-on so we advise to use the qemu driver" — now misleading (we run docker with ingress-nginx; host access via tunnel). Update the comment.
- **[Low] Orphaned `network` variable** in `modules/k8s/minicluster` — unused now that `main` doesn't pass `socket_vmnet`. Harmless (default null); keep for module reusability or remove in a cleanup. No action required.

## Deferred from: Story 2.1 (secrets) → Stories 2.5/2.6

- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.6] Wire the generated Postgres password into the Postgres app + remove plaintext.** `module.application_db.auth.password` → `random_password.postgres.result`; the `DATA_PASSWORD` plaintext was removed entirely with the vestigial `extraEnv` block. NFR3 met — no password literal remains in `12-airflow.tf`.
- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.6] Add `depends_on` from the airflow ArgoCD application to the secrets.** `module.application` now `depends_on` all three: `airflow_config_credentials`, `airflow_metadata`, `airflow_result_backend`.
- **[Low → Story 2.6 — declined, kept hardcoded] Consider deriving the metadata `connection` user/db/host from the Postgres app params** instead of hardcoded `mini`/`mini_data_platform`/`postgres-postgresql`. Declined: the module exposes these as a flat `parameters` map (no structured output to reference), so deriving would add fragile string-plumbing for no runtime benefit on this local cluster. Both connection secrets + the DB share the same literals; drift risk is low. Revisit only if the values move to variables.
- **[Low] random_* have no `keepers`** — stable across normal applies; on taint/state-loss they regenerate (fernet rotation would orphan encrypted metadata, but the metadata DB is disposable per PRD). Acceptable for this local cluster; revisit only if persistence matters.

## Deferred from: Story 2.3 (values port) → Stories 2.6 / 2.7

- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.6] Create the `airflow-result-backend` Secret.** `kubernetes_secret.airflow_result_backend` added in `12-airflow.tf` with key `connection = db+postgresql://mini:<pw>@postgres-postgresql.data.svc.cluster.local:5432/mini_data_platform` (the `db+` prefix). (Workers actually persisting results is runtime — Story 2.7.)
- **[PARTIALLY RESOLVED in Story 2.7 → new follow-up below] SimpleAuth admin password.** Login **verified working** (`POST /auth/token` → 201). Mechanism resolved: SimpleAuthManager auto-generates the `admin` password to an **ephemeral pod-local file** on each api-server start (the `admin-password` key in `airflow-config-credentials` is still unused). Retrieve via `kubectl -n data logs deploy/airflow-api-server -c api-server | grep "Password for user 'admin'"`. ⚠️ The password **changes on every api-server restart** — see new follow-up for pinning.
- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.6] Fix `module.application` extraEnv nesting.** The double-nested `values.airflow.airflow.extraEnv` block was removed entirely — `DATA_DB`/`DATA_USER`/`DATA_PASSWORD` had no consumer anywhere in the repo (verified by grep across `airflow/ helms/ terraform/`). `module.application` now carries no inline `values`; all config lives in `values.yaml`. This also removed the last `DATA_PASSWORD` plaintext.
- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.7] Redis/broker hook-annotated secrets.** Both `airflow-broker-url` and `airflow-redis-password` exist at steady state under ArgoCD; worker log shows `Connected to redis://...@airflow-redis:6379/0` and `celery@... ready`. Broker reachable.
- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.7] base_url https vs ingress TLS.** UI + `/api/v2/monitor/health` function over the tunnel on HTTP; no redirect loop. `base_url=https` is cosmetic for local. Adding ingress TLS is optional polish (not required for verification).

## Deferred from: Story 2.4 (DAG/tooling migration) -> Story 2.7 / operator

- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.7] Relock `poetry.lock`** — relocked in a py3.12 env: `apache-airflow 2.8.2 → 3.2.2`.
- **[RESOLVED in Story 2.7] `airflow config lint` + `airflow.sdk` imports + DAG parse** — run in the live Airflow-3 env. Found a real DAG import bug (`ScheduleArg` not re-exported from `airflow.sdk`, fixed). `airflow dags list` → `my_dag_name`, no import errors. config lint's remaining findings are upstream chart defaults — see new follow-up.

## Deferred from: Story 2.7 (deploy & verify) → follow-ups

- **[Med → follow-up] Pin the SimpleAuth admin password (deterministic login).** The password regenerates on every api-server restart (ephemeral file). To pin: set `config.core.simple_auth_manager_passwords_file` to a mounted JSON file `{"admin":"<pw>"}` sourced from a TF secret (we already generate `random_password.admin`; reformat the secret to JSON and add a volume mount on the api-server). Beyond Story 2.7's small-fix scope (needs a TF secret reshape + chart `volumes`/`volumeMounts`). Until then, retrieve the live password from the api-server logs.
- **[Low → follow-up] `airflow config lint` flags two upstream-chart defaults.** `enable_proxy_fix` (in `[webserver]`, moved to `[fab]` in Airflow 3) and `load_default_connections` (removed in Airflow 3) are baked into the official chart 1.22.0's default `airflow.cfg`, not our values (verified: removing `load_default_connections` from `values.yaml` did not clear it from the rendered configmap). Cosmetic — platform fully functional. Track upstream (apache/airflow helm chart) or override chart config defaults if a clean lint is desired.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-6-update-terraform-argocd-application-and-wiring (2026-06-20)

- **[High → Story 2.7] Bitnami Postgres only honors `auth.password` on first PVC init.** Story 2.6 set `module.application_db.auth.password = random_password.postgres.result` and pointed all three connection secrets at the same password. But the Bitnami `postgresql` chart only applies `auth.password` when the data dir is empty (first init). If the `postgres` app already has a populated PVC at the 2.7 live apply, the role keeps the old `data` password while Airflow's metadata + result-backend connections use the new generated one → auth failure, despite a clean `terraform apply`/Synced state. At 2.7: confirm the postgres PVC is fresh (cluster was recreated in Story 1.3, so likely empty), or recreate the PVC / `ALTER ROLE mini PASSWORD '<generated>'`. Both independent review layers flagged this. [terraform/main/12-airflow.tf:123]

## Deferred from: code review of 2-7-deploy-and-verify-airflow-3-0-end-to-end (2026-06-20)

- **[Low → follow-up] `ScheduleArg` imported from an internal submodule.** `airflow/mini_dags/chester/dag.py` imports `ScheduleArg` from `airflow.sdk.definitions.dag` (not the public `airflow.sdk` surface — it isn't re-exported there in 3.2.2). Works now; a minor Airflow 3.x bump could relocate it and break DAG parsing. Harden with `from __future__ import annotations` + a `TYPE_CHECKING` import (it's used only as a type annotation), or a `try/except ImportError` fallback. Revisit at the next Airflow upgrade.
- **[Low → follow-up] JWT-secret rotation rollout coordination.** With `jwtSecretName` now pinned to `random_password.jwt_secret` (in `airflow-config-credentials`), rotating that value (TF taint/re-apply) invalidates in-flight JWTs until **both** api-server and scheduler restart → transient 401s mid-rollout. Document a rolling-restart step on rotation, or add `lifecycle { ignore_changes }` if rotation isn't desired. Not triggered by normal ArgoCD sync.
- **[Process → Epic 2 retro / Epic 3] Verify-story merged to `main`.** Story 2.7 merged `feat/airflow-3-k8s-133-upgrade` → `main` (operator-approved, required so ArgoCD `target_revision=HEAD`/gitSync `branch: main` serve the cutover). This front-runs Epic 3's reproducibility (3.1) and rollback-rehearsal (3.3) gates. Note in the Epic 2 retrospective; Epic 3 should run its clean-state/rollback tests against the now-merged `main`.

### Out-of-scope notes (operator / correct-course, not story-assigned)
- **k8s 1.33 EOL is 2026-06-28** (≈9 days after the 1.33 target was locked). The 1.33 target is fixed by the PRD/Architecture; revisiting it (e.g. toward 1.34) would be a `correct-course` decision, not a dev change.
- **terraform-docs/helm-docs version drift** — the local terraform-docs emits `<br/>` where committed argocd-module READMEs have `<br>`. Recommend a housekeeping commit to align local tool versions with CI so pre-commit doesn't churn unrelated docs.
