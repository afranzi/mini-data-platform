At the heart of this project lies a carefully curated stack comprising Terraform, Minikube, ArgoCD, and Airflow.
Each tool has been selected for its strength in automating and managing infrastructure, orchestrating deployments, and
scheduling complex workflows, respectively. Together, they form a robust framework that enables users to deploy a
miniature yet fully-functional data platform cluster with ease.
